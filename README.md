### Setup

Install project dependencies:

```

Start the development server:

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

## How to Use the App

My Bookshelf is a book management app that allows you to organize books into three categories: read, want to read, and currently reading. You can change or remove a book from its bookshelf by clicking the light blue button on the book's cover.

### Backend API

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and utilizes a set of search terms found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). The list contains the only searchable terms that work with the backend.
